# birch-markdown package

This is a work in progress to author Markdown in the Birch outliner.

This package contains commands for setting Markdown `data-type`s on items. Example types include `heading`, `codeblock`, `orderedlist`, etc. It also contains styles so those types are visible in the outline editor. And it also includes a "Copy As Markdown" command that will convert the outline into Markdown and put that text on the clipboard.

## To install

1. Download this package

2. Open this package directory in Terminal.app and then:

	- `apm install`

	- `apm link`
